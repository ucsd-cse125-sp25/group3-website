    <h1>Angie Week 3 Report</h1>
    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <p>My goals were to determine what I wanted to use to implement the networking for our game and to create a simple echo server using that tool</p>
    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <p>Working with April, I was able to accomplish both; we have a working echo server for both a Winsock implementation and Asio implementation.</p>
    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <p>Originally for networking we had settled on using Winsock since there was a nice skeleton code to implement it quickly and we didnâ€™t want to deal with the overhead of using a library. However, the cross-platform aspect of Asio was appealing and we ended up looking into its implementation as well.</p>
    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <p>My specific goal for next week is to implement the full client/server as described in the lecture slides.</p>
    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
    <p>I learned about sockets, async vs sync servers, TCP vs UDP protocols, and libraries to help implement the client/server. I expected to learn these things to accomplish the goals for this week. Unexpectedly, I learned more about C++ compilation and linking.</p>
    <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
    <p>I plan to pick up the pace for next week but feel good about meeting the goals for the starting week</p>
