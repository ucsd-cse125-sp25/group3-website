            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals were to figure out the bug from last week with the packets, get the integration branch up to date to use the packet classes, figure out the issue with the lab computers and continue moving game logic from client to server.

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to figure out the bug from last week after understanding how the window & cube classes worked better. I was also able to get the integration branch up to date after a great deal of merge conflicts, though still have to make it compatible with the new multiplayer feature. April carried this week for the latter two goals.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
              Merging into the integration branch took longer than expected, lesson learned to merge sooner and often
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal is to finish merging together the multiplayer feature to work with the packet classes. I also want to modify the packet classes so that they are dynamically sized and only send relevant state that changed, but I will potentially jump to gameplay if there's more pressing goals to prioritize there.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned more about Git and Github's UI for it as well as C++'s neat auto keyword which was useful in dealing with the packets.

                Pretty good, looking forward to see the game take shape more
