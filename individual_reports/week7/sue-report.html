            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals for this week were to finish implementing animations.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was not able to finish implementing animations. I am currently debugging my current implementation of getting basic animations to play.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I wasn't able to finish up animations. Trying to translate the assimp data structures to the concepts I learned in CSE 169 were difficult, and debugging is going slower than I'd like.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My specific goals for the next week are to please get animations done. What was originally planned for next week was lighting -- as what we currently have implemented is a single directional light. So I may work on that too. However, the priority is animations.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned more about Assimp. Like that when they say OffsetMatrix they mean inverse Bind matrix.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                My morale is a little bit low, due to not being able to make the planned deadline for animations.
