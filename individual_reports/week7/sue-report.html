            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals for this week were to get working on animations, more specifically to get the animations themselves to work without skinning (ie. play on a skeleton).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was not able to get animations playing on skeletons without skinning. I instead looked into where animations are stored in the assimp scenes, and how animations are handled by previous groups.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I wasn't able to get to as much as I thought I would be able to. The way that animations are stored in Assimp were in a different format than what I was expecting and animations were handled in a different manner than I initially thought they would be by previous groups.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My specific goals for the next week are to finish animations, or at the very least get animations playing on a simple skeleton (ie. represent each node by a cube).
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned about how Assimp stores animations and related data.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                My morale is less high than last week, as I wasn't able to do as much as I was hoping. I'm also a bit concerned about how integration will go, hopefully leaving clear documentation will help for integrating the graphics portion.
