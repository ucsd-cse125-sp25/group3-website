                1. Add show on mini map ability. <br>
                2. Helping fixing UI bug

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                Add show on mini map the ability. No too much work done this week.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I originally planned to fix the UI bug this week, but I realized there are too many parts I'm not familiar with. Since I wasn't the one who implemented the UI, it might be better to hand this off to the person who originally added it.            
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              - Testing npc in real museum map, being prepared to moving on integration. <br>
              - Check if other part need help. 
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
              In order to implement the multiplayer-related ability, I reviewed the integration code with networking. It gave me a much better understanding of how the server and client interact.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
               Good. The main part of gameplay are down. But feeling still quite far from the final version.
