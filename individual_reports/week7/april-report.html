            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for the week was to figure out how to run the 
                server and client on the lab computers and to add 
                multiplayer support to the server and client.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I got the client and server running on the lab computers. I 
                also got multiplayer support added to both the server 
                and the client, so each client can now see the other 
                clients in the game and the server updates and sends 
                everybody's state.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                The week actually went better than I thought it would. 
                Since I've had so much trouble with CMake in the past, 
                I thought getting the server and client to run on the 
                lab computers would take forever to figure out. But it 
                turns out the compiler was just losing its mind over 
                some really silly bugs in our code.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for this coming week is to fix a bug with how 
                the server handles key presses: it currently processes 
                every key press the client sends, but this causes the 
                cube's speed to be inconsistent on different devices. 
                Gameplay has also finished one of the security guard's 
                abilities (see thieves' positions on minimap), so I'm 
                going to move the logic for that to the server.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                Never used Visual Studio before so learned a bit about it 
                while trying to get the server and client running on the lab 
                computers. I also had to share the lab with a bunch of high 
                schoolers on Saturday, so I learned that high school boys 
                are still as obnoxious as I remember them being.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                The work for this week is very straightforward and I've 
                decided that my other assignments are just figments of 
                my imagination, so I'm feeling pretty cheery.
