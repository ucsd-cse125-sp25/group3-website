            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals for the the week were to work on collisions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to write collision functions, and functions for generating bounding boxes in world coordinates for axis-aligned bounding boxes.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I wasn't able to do as much work for collisions as I expected, part of the reason was because I am having difficulty getting the previous week's graphics work integrated with the main branch.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goals for the next week are to get texture mapping working and continue to work on the collision code.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned a lot about CMake, and I found a couple good resources on calculating collisions.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                My morale is not high or low, I am kind of worried for integration, and time as things start to speed up in other classes, but I should be okay.
