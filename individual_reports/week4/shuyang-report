            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                For this week, my concrete goals are create a minimap, and add interactions between characters and artifacts
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                - add a minimap at the left-up corner that is a orthogonal camera of the map <br>
                
                - add interactions between characters and artifact, now the theives could grab the artifact.<br>
                
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I initially plan to also add UI along with the interaction(like a hint shows "press F to grab" when get close enough), 
                but I am not familiar with Imgui, that took me a long time to understand it, so currently there's no UI hint.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              - add UIs with interactions.<br>
                
              - adjust the minimap so that it would be the top view fixed with character center, and could change with the character <br>
                
              - work with networking people to finalized some abilities that need multiplayers support.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
              - I learnt some knowledge of the ImGui, but still need to read more<br>
                
              - I learnt how to add a second camera to the map like works as an orthogonal camera that could use for minimap

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
              A bit stressed because other courses' assignments and midterms, but also excited with following work.
