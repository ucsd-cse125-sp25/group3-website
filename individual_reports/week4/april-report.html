            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                For networking, my goal for the week was to start integrating 
                the graphics client with our current server and client implementations. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to get a basic graphics client and server setup working. 
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I don't think the week neccesarily went differently than planned: I got 
                what I wanted to done, but it turns out there's more game logic that 
                needs to be moved over than I originally thought. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for this coming week is to continue moving game logic 
                from the graphics client to the server. There's also a couple of
                bugs in the current code that I'd like to get ironed out before
                I forget about them. If the issue with the lab computer ports gets
                fixed this week, it'd also be nice to confirm that our server and 
                client work on separate machines.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I (re)learned that pointers are annoying! Honestly, this week's 
                work was mostly just trying to remember C++ stuff I used to know and 
                sticking print statements into every inch of my code to debug, so 
                I didn't really learn anything new.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                Now that I have a basic graphics client and server working together, 
                I'm less worried about my progress than I was last week because now 
                I have a general idea of how to split the game logic and rendering 
                between the server and graphics client. So, in theory, moving 
                additional game logic over to the server should go faster now. That 
                said, I have a lot of assignments due this week, so I'm a little 
                concerned about how I'm going to manage all of that and also find 
                time to work on the game. It is a ✨stressful✨ time.
