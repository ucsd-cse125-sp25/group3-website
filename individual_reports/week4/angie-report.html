            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal was to implement the full client/server and focus on integrating it with the graphics team.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to get the packet class designed last week to work with our client/server implementation and set up unit testing.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
               It went about as expected for this week.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                I want to continue working on integration between networking and graphics for next week and perhaps work on optimizations on the networking side if there's extra time. I was also thinking about setting up a pipeline for the repository now that there's testing.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned more about C++ in general, working with CMake and how to account for different systems, and how to set up unit testing using GoogleTest as a framework. I was expecting to learn more about testing this week but not the struggle with CMake.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                Pretty good! I feel more settled in to the project.
