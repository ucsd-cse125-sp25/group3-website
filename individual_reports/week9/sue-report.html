            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals for this week were to make the graphics system easier to use and to merge in all of the graphics into the rest of the project, it was also to check of all the models and confirm that they are being loaded in correctly (including their animations and textures).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to complete all of my goals!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                The animation system part of the graphics code was not running on the Mac. The reason this was happening was that there were meshes that did not have uv coordinates, and Mac would crash trying to assign nonexistent uvs to vertices.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My specific goals for next week are to finish working with Heather to get the model textures and animations fully working and confirmed, and to look into a bug where the animation can "glitch" very rarely (it happened previously I still have to confirm whether it's still happening).
                Depending on performance, I may also implement GPU instancing for animations.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned about OpenGL on Mac, and some specifics of how to export on Blender.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                My morale is pretty high, though I am not very sure whether I'll be able to resolve the rare animation bug.
