            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals for the week was to create the VFX for the game.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                There was a change in plans; as me and my team were unsure if we would have time to implement vfx to our game, we decided to focus on importing/exporting existing meshes and possibily create another thief model (male).

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                As there are two other projects that are due this week, I didn't have enough time to create another male thief character.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for next week is to finish creating the game with my team!

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned this week about the importance of communication. I had to go back and forth with Sue (graphics) a lot to export my models in a way that loads correctly in our game engine.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>

                My morale is pretty high.
