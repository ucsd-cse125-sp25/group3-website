            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                1. Collision
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                1. have the code for collision, but due to bugs with mac, unable to test it. 
                2. add the catch ability for security guard. 
                
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I was unable to test collision. I should have time to at least test it on windows but I start it too late.  
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              Finish and test collision.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
