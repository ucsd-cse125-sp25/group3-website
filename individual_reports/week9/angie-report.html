            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal was to work on integration between the gameplay and server logic
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to move part of the minigame logic to work with the server, though it is still in the process of being debugged 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                Getting the minigame actions to work with the server is taking up more time than I thought and might need to change the calculation logic for it
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
               My goal is to finish the minigame integration and work on any gameplay elements / further integration as needed before the demo
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I didn't learn anything too new, it was mostly work built on the previous weeks
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                Nervous about the upcoming demo
            </p>
