            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My original goal for the week was to get the start page 
                and character selection pages integrated with the server 
                and client. Upon checking the calendar and realizing we 
                had less than a week left, I decided that it would be in 
                all of our best interests if I also started integrating 
                the graphics into the server and client.

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to get the start page and character selection 
                page integrated with the server and client, and added 
                some logic to synchronize character selection and game 
                start among the clients. I also got the graphics code 
                integrated with the server and client, so now the museum 
                and characters all render. Except on Mac.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                There's a bug somewhere that's causing the graphics code 
                to segfault on Mac, which means my development has been 
                limited to whenever I can be in the lab. 
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                To finish the game (please ;-;). More specifically, I plan 
                to add the ability for the third thief and to iron out any 
                remaining bugs in the graphics integration. Outside of that,
                I'll pitch in wherever needed.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                Learned a bit about the graphics code while trying to 
                get it integrated into the server and client. Also learned 
                a bit about ImGui while integrating the start page and 
                character selection page into the server and client. 
                Finally, learned a bit more about CMake because surprise, 
                surprise, it hated the merging of the animation branch 
                into the multiplayer branch.
