            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>

                Finish all UI design.

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I had the ui element positions all sorted out so it stays in the right places even when window resizes.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                We wanted a minecraft style start menu (have scenes of the museum as the background) but I had to wait for them to integrate the graphics first.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
             Add audio.
