            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal was to continue to work on client ticks and work on integration with graphics.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                We ended up moving away from client ticks, the idea was to help with cheating detection or dealing with outdated packets but decided it wasn't beneficial for the demo. I ended up reworking the code to be encapsulated in packet classes and am mostly done with the different types (init, state update, key event), but there's a bug that causes the model to jitter.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
              I ended up on different tasks than I expected for the week after discussing it with April. Also was surprised by an urgent care visit, but I'm still workshopping the story behind that (right now I'm leaning towards a fight with a shark)

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                I want to figure out the bug with the packet classes, continue moving any game logic to the server, and figure out the issue with the lab computers.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned more about OpenGL and rendering to try and figure out the issue with the jittering model, and also (re)learned more about C++ and how it deals with pointers and inherited/base classes.

                Feeling behind and want to catch up more this week
