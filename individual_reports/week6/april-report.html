            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for the week was to get the graphics client and 
                server running on the lab computers. Additionally, I 
                wanted to fix some bugs relating to client disconnects 
                and how recv is called. Finally, if I had additional time, 
                I wanted to continue moving game logic from the client to 
                the server.

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to rewrite the server and client to a) handle 
                client disconnects gracefully and b) read in packets by 
                calling recv in a loop. I also moved the logic for the 
                main camera, minimap camera, cursor movement, and alt key 
                presses to the server.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I started trying to get the graphics client and server 
                running on the lab computers on Friday but CMake was being 
                a pain so I wasn't successful. The plan was to go back to 
                the lab on Saturday and get all of that figured out, but 
                something came up and I couldn't go. As such, as of right 
                now the graphics client and server still don't work on the 
                lab computers.

            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for this coming week is to actually get the graphics client 
                and server working on the lab computers. If I happen to 
                accomplish that with some time to spare, I want to get 
                started on adding multiplayer support to the client and 
                server. Additionally, for when I have free time but can't 
                be in the lab, the plan is to fix a bug with the camera 
                and continue moving game logic to the server.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                In the process of trying to run the graphics client and 
                server on the lab computers using CMake, I'm learning more 
                about how to use CMake, particularly for Windows. The 
                compiler doesn't seem to care, however, and continues to 
                throw up regardless of how I modify the CMake file.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                CMake is quickly becoming the bane of my existence and I 
                have another essay to write, so uh, not exactly looking 
                forward to this week.
