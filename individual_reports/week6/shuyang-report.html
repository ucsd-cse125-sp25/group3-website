            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                finish the re-entering mini game.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                1. add jumping platforms to the minigame <br>
                2. add collisions between the character and the platforms <br>
                
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                This week went align with my plan.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              1. redesign the positions of some platforms so that I can add bottom collision and make the jumping does not looks wired. <br>
              2. work with networking people to integrate other logics.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
              Since the SFWL keybord does not work for Mac, I learn and use glew and glfw to recreate the window and add keybord movement for the character.             
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
               I'm bit worried about integration in the follwing steps since there are lot things overlap and need to work together.
