            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                1. Finalizing npc movement logic. <br>
                2. Load model movement and use that instead of cube.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                1. Added random stop for npc movement so that it looks more natual. <br>
                2. Added Character class that can load model and have key board control.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I think this week went mostly meet the expectations. 
            </p>

            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              - fix bugs with UI
              - Integrate several components. (The Character class is in a different branch from the main gameplay, and it's missing some functions. 
                Additionally, animation for the character model might also be implemented here. Finally these things need to integrate with networking.)
              - improving coding structure, it's currently quite messy and unorganized.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
              Reviewed how to coordinate between different classes. 
              Nothing particularly new, but it was a helpful refresher.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
               Good, I think we've nearly finished creating the core components. The next major task is integrating them.
