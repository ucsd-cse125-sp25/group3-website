              - Looked at server and client 
              - learn about auto deployment using github actions

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                I feel like we (as members in a class) should be ramping up and start really going in and put in a lot of work, the past week I feel like I myself have not done too much.
