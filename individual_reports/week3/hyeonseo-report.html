            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals for the week was to create the base mesh for the thieves and the security guard.

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to create a thief and a security guard model. 
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                My initial goal was to create two thief models (one male and one female), but I could create only one due to time constraints. If I do not get the time to create the male thief, we might not import the appearance-shifting ability of the thieves in the game. This change won't affect the game too much, as it isn't one of the core features of the game.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goals for the next week are to finishing UV unwrapping and shading (coloring) the models I created during the last week.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                It took a while for me to create the first model, but I was able to build the second model in a much faster speed after learning a few new sculpting tactics and shortcuts. For example, I learned that controlling the brush size using the 'f' key is more efficient than pressing on '[' or ']'. Moreoever, I learned how to sculpt hands by following a Youtube tutotial. I wasn't expecting to learn all these new useful skills in one week, which is surprisingly awesome!

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                My morale is pretty high. The last week was a bit stressful as I anticipated, but the following weeks are hopefully going to be easier for me as I have the base meshes for the characters ready.
