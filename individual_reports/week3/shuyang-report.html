            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                For this week, as member of gameplay, we want to finalize the game flow, finish basic control logic, and set up the camera and character movement.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                - Discuss the complete gameflow and special choices of abilities with others.<break>
                
                - set up the free-look camera, that the view could change with the movement of mouse.<break>
                
                - disable/able the mouse on the screen, make it more immersive.<break>
                
                - talk with networking people and leart the different things need to do on server and client.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                In our schedule, we want to finish the ability of the security guard this week, but we only decide what abilities she should have, not yet implement it
                One reason is the unfamiliar with other people(e.g.networking)'s work, one ability of the security guard is to show locations of the thieves, which means
                we need the multi-player support, but we do not have it yet. Maybe we need to enforce the connection between different parts of our group.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              - talk with networking people and implement the abolities of the security guard.<break>
                
              - start doing player interations(e.g. thieves grab the artifact, security guard catch thieves...)<break>
                
              - make a small map at the up-left corner(correspond to security guard's ability).

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
              - I leart the difference between client and server, and found out we need to move what we have implement so far from client to server, and need to create a signal sending function on client.<break>
                
              - How to make a free-look camera and the disable/able of mouse. It is like the most open-world game, and it is easier than I though. I learn more about the keyborad callback through implement them.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
              Generally good, it feels great to implement some functions that like the games I daily play, but I'm also worry about the workload in following weeks, and also the balance between the project and my other courses' work.
