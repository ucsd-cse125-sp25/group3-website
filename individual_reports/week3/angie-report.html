            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal was to implement the full client/server.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I wasn't able to complete this goal for the week but have made progress toward it; I worked with April to refactor the code to work with both MacOS and Windows. I also worked on designing a general packet structure.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                The beginning of the week we were unsure about whether we wanted to continue with sockets or using a library like Boost but ultimately settled on sockets.
                We also faced issues with the server/client code working for localhost but not when we manually gave our device's IP address. We're still trying to narrow down the reasons for this as we suspected it was related to the firewall on the lab machines, but are still experiencing issues after the ports were opened.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal is still to implement the full client/server. I'll work with April on designing packets for Cube/Window and get it to send only updated game state rather than all of it.
            </p>

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned more about TCP and framing. I also learned more about IP addresses and how to determine them through a C program, as well as how to write code compatible for multiple platforms. Unexpectedly, I learned how to use CMake.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                A bit worried about pacing but feeling pretty good about the project.
