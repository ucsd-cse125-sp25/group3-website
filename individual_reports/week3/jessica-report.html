            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                For gameplay, our goal is to fix movement and camera, discussing special abilities and control logic.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                Adjusted jumping, got camera move align with the cube and corrected direction. 
                Made the project also compatible with macOS system. 
                Discussed special abilities and game flow.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                This week mostly went as expected. We realized that some features, 
                like interactions and abilities, require support from the server-client system and multiplayer framework. 
                While we can built the basic implementation on our side, 
                full functionality will depend on integration with other parts of the project.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              Discussing and confirming on game flow. Start implementing abilities. Add player interactions.
            </p>

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
              Learned about how to run the same project cross platform, it was easier than I thought, 
                and also about how server and client working and how will gameplay side integrate with that <break>

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
              Good! Little worried about if there will be tons of bug when integrating everything.
