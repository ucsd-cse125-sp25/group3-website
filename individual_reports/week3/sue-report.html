            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals for the week was to get the Assimp importer working so that we can take 3D models and load their mesh geometry into the game.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to get the Assimp importer working and the model meshes loaded and rendering in the game.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                The week went slightly differently than I had planned. The final pipeline I ended up with for importing models is a bit clunky because the .dll from building the Assimp library currently must be manually moved to the folder where the executable of the game is located. I may write a shell script, eventually, to automate this.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goals for the next week are to work on collisions. Physics is being worked on by other group members, so I will be focusing on collisions, which will likely mean I will be working on implementing bounding boxes and collision detection of bounding boxes.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned a lot about how the Assimp library works, and how to write CMakeLists.
            </p>

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                My morale is fairly high. I did tear my hair out a little working with Assimp, but now that I've gotten it to listen to me, I'm doing pretty okay.
