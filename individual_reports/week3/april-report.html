            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                For networking, our goals for the week were to finish building a 
                full server and client, and to rewrite the server and client so that 
                they could run on both Windows and Mac. We were also hoping to get the 
                client and server working on separate machines.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to rewrite the server code so that it could run on both 
                Windows and Mac. 
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I was hoping to get the server and client working on separate 
                machines, but the lab computer ports are still not working, so we 
                fell back to our old faithful, localhost. I was also planning to 
                incorporate both the game logic into the server and the input 
                handling and rendering into the client, but that code currently 
                requires using cmake. Angie and I were both having issues getting 
                said code to compile and run with cmake, so we haven't been able to 
                actually start moving that code into the server and client.

            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for this coming week is to split out the rendering and 
                input handling from the game logic, and get the former added to 
                the client, and the latter to the server.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned that I should've taken this class twenty five years ago 
                when firewalls and networking weren't so complicated. In all 
                seriousness, though, rewriting the server code to work on both 
                Mac and Windows meant that I spent a lot of time looking through the 
                documentation for the socket- and networking-related 
                function calls in our code, and as a result, I have a much 
                better idea of what those function calls do. I also learned a 
                lot more than I ever intended to about cmake while trying to 
                get the OpenGL code to run on my laptop.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a little concerned since we're behind schedule, but I'm 
                hoping the hard part (getting someone else's code to run on 
                my laptop) is over, and the rest will be easier.
