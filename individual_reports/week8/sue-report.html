            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals for this week were to finish the animation system, and attempt to load in the models we have so far.

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to finish the animation system, load in the models, and test the animations we have so far.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                The week went a little differently than I expected, as to expand the animation system, I had to change the organization of the files.

            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My specific goals for the next week are to make the graphics system easier to use, as it is currently exceeding complicated to use.
