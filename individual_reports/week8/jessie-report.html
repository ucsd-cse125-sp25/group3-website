            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for the week was to integrate the game with the minigame that shuyang created and continue on the UI design.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I met up with Shuyang to merge UI and minigame branches while waiting for our teammates to integrate the other game logic first. I also explored the UI designs of other games and created a story board for our ui design.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I talked to sue and find out we might not get character customization (change of appearls) unless we have extra time, so I am revoming that stage for now.

            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                Finish all UI design.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned about how buffer swaps works in opengl. The flickering issue was caused because I called glfwSwapBuffers(window) in the wrong location. I was also able to find out setting the swap interval to sync with monitor's refresh rate could help with the issue.

                Oh no its week 9.
