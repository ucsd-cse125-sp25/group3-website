            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                1. Help with integrate gameplay-npc branch. 
                2. Work on collision.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                1. meet with networking people, help with merge code.
                2. use assimp library to calculate bounding box. 
                
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                Collision need more thing than I expected. The model load we have before only work for .ply file, but we have fbx model. 
                Also, the one bounding box for human model is easy to do, but for museum map with walls and booth, more adjustment needed. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              Finish and test collision. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
              I learned the underlying logic of how collision detection works in a game, 
              and how to practically implement it.           
              I also learned how the Assimp library can be used to extract bounding boxes from 3D models to support collision detection.
          </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
               Good, but a little bit worried about the overall process.
