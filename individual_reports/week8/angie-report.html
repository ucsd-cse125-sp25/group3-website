            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goals were to finish integrating the packet classes to catch up with the multiplayer feature on the networking branch, implement dynamic packets, and work on integration with gameplay
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                After a debugging session, the packet classes are now fully caught up with the server code. I didn't end up working on dynamic packets since integration was a bigger priority, but the newest gameplay features for the week are now merged, though some still need to be moved to server logic.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                This week was pretty straight-forward and I didn't run into anything unexpected.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
               I plan to continue working on integration as needed, starting with updating the minigame to communicate with the server.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned that it's really helpful to have fresh eyes on bugged code because it was resolved way faster than I expected
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                A bit worried that there's going to be a lot to be done in the final weeks but pretty good
