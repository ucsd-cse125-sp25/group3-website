            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for the week was to integrate the gameplay-npc 
                branch into our server and client. I also wanted to 
                fix a bug on the server that resulted in inconsistent 
                client speeds.

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                A few of us met up on Thursday and we were able to 
                merge the gameplay-npc branch into the multiplayer 
                branch. I was then able to move over the new gameplay 
                logic (NPCs, security guard ability, grabbing artifact) 
                to the server. I was also able to fix the bug with the 
                client speeds.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I thought getting the new game logic integrated into 
                the client and server would be a lot more difficult 
                than it actually was, so I got more done than I expected to.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for this coming week is to get the UI code 
                integrated with our server and client. If gameplay 
                has any new logic that they've finished in the last 
                week, I'd also like to get that moved over to the 
                server asap.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                After spending three hours tearing my hair out 
                over what I thought was a game-breaking bug only 
                to find out it was due to me incrementing with the 
                wrong variable, I learned (for the upteenth time) 
                that I am an idiot and to never assume that any 
                portion of my code works.
