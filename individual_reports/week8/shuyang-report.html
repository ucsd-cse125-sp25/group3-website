            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                1. Merge the minigame and UI together <br>
                2. Fix the incompatiblility between Core profile and immediate Mode (using VAO, VBO and shader to replace OpenGL 2.1 system) <br>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I suppose to merge the gameplay with networking people this week, but because of the incompatible, it coast me lots time to change the whole system of the minigame, so currently only merge the npc stuff not the minigame.

            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              1. Merge the minigame and ui with networking people <br>
              2. If have time, search some sounds effect and add it in the game.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
               Feel a bit tired with changing the whole system, and also worry about the process.
