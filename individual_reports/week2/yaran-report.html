            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                For gameplay, our goal is to finish the basic gameplay movement and control logic

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>

                Planning and discussing about how to achieve the gameplay movement and control logic, as well as the gameplay logic and flow.

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I think for the overall gameplay goal we met most of our expectations.
                But for me this weekend I was busier than I expected so I did not contribute too much to the implementation part. 
                I’ll contribute more actively in the coming week on the actual implementation part.

            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
              1. Finalized the camera movement and the character's viewport behavior.
              2. Specified the character's special abilities.
              3. Had discussions with other teams to prepare for integration work.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                Learned more about the underlying systems required to make a game work.
                Review and re-learned knowledge from past courses like 169.

            <p>
              I'm excited about this project and curious to see what will happen next week. At the same time, I also feel a bit concerned—there are still many things that need to be done, and a lot of them are areas I haven't worked with before.
