            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals for the week were to re-familiarize myself with OpenGL, set up the framework for the graphics portion of our project, and get a cube to display and respond to keyboard input.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to accomplish all of my goals this week, as they were designed to be relatively simple to account for the time it would take for me to refamiliarize myself with how to work with OpenGL and its related libraries.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                The week went mostly as I had planned, with the only difficulty being refamiliarizing myself with CMake -- as it has been a while since I've had to use it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My specific goals for the next week are to look into the specifications for file formats we can export from Blender for model and animation information. Then, add functionality to load in a model's geometry from said file format. I will also likely add a new shader to check for the correctness of the normals.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I re-learned how to use CMake this week, I did not expect to have forgotten so much about it.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                My morale is pretty high, though I am a bit concerned on how I will be able to balance the work for the game with the rest of my classes as the tasks increase in complexity.
