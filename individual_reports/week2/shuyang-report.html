            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                I am responsible for the gameplay part in our group, so the concrete goal this week is to working 
                with the graphic member finish the movement together, add jumping function, and think of further control logic.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                1. finish basic movement, holding press wasd could let the object continuesly move.
                2. adding some physics(gravity, velocity) to the object.
                3. Using the basic physics to finsih the jumping function(still with some little problems)
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I was also considering adding the changing scene function, like not needing to press the 
                mouse to move the scen, but the perspective would just change with the movement of mouse.
                However, I didn't finish that part, it was my first time coding on the Windows platform, 
                which has some differences with what I did on Mac, it took me time on setting up.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                1. finish the scene change with the movement of mouse
                2. talk with the artist and try to get the movement and jump logic work on a human model
                3. decide further game logic, especially the different abilities that the security guard and thieves have.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I am getting more fimilar with the user interact part of C++, learning how to change teh conditions in the window with key board and mouse.
                I also learn how to apply physics in code, previousely I know lots physics formular but unfamiliar with them in code, and I implement a simple one this week.

            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                I would say both excited and nervous. When I actually start coding, I found a lot of things need to do but we didn't talk early. For example,
                now I am considering when apply the movement on the human model, we need to attach the skeleton and skin, and make animation when walking and 
                jumping, those are need to be further discussed with the artist and graphic members in group, which makes me a bit worry. but I also feel very 
                excited to see a game that is getting start in our group.
