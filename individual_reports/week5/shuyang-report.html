            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for this week is to start the re-enter mini-game
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I make the background picture(with the help from chatGPT) <br>
                I create a new window for the mini-game and loaded the background picture and initialize the pixelized-charater.

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I originally want to fix some bugs of grabing things and mini-map, but the files involved has some confliction with person working on imGui,
                so I decide to start the mini-game first, but the mini-game involved with SFML, which I have not touched, and it took me a lot of time to initialize it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                1. continue with the re-entering mini-game <br>
                2. fix the bugs with grabing item and mini-camera <br>
                3. working with UI together with other gameplay people <br>

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learnt some knowledge about SFML that now I know how to import a 2D picture into a 3D window, and add the character Sprite to control it
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                Good. I want to spend more time on the game next week as I have finished some other assignments and midterms.
