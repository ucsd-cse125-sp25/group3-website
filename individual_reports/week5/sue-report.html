            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My concrete goals were to get building through CMake when using the Assimp library to work without manually copying the .dll, and to get uv-mapped textures working. Then, if I had more time, to work on refining the code for collisions.

            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to get the CMake with Assimp working by having a command after building to copy over the .dll if on a Windows computer. UV-mapped textures are functional, and I reorganized how meshes would be organized, individual meshes are now collected under a model class, which moves the meshes together, while the scene class holds a collection of models in one structure (this is aimed to help collisions).

            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                Implementing textures were simpler than I had expected, though I am a bit concerned for whether the current library I am using to load in the texture data from a file path is robust enough to use later, as stb_image is quite a small library.

            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                My specific goals for the next week are to get working on animations -- for which I've portioned two weeks, I will likely be working with getting a skeleton and its related classes created, then getting that skeleton to move to match a loaded animation. If I have more time, I will likely be working on getting the mesh to move to match the skeleton (skinning) which would mean I would be looking into where the weight values are stored in Assimp.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned about how texture mapping works and some details on how OpenGL's binding and uniform functions work. I also, once again, learned about CMake and its many quirks.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                My morale is better than last week, though I am a bit nervous about how animations are going to go, as it seems like a pretty daunting task.
