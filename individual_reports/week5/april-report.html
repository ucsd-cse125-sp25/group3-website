            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for the week was to continue moving gameplay logic 
                from the client to the server. 
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to move the logic for handling jumping and the 
                thieves' abilities (thief 1 and 2) to the server. After 
                five weeks of limbo, I was also able to confirm that our 
                server and client work on separate lab computers. Yay!

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I had a history paper sucking up all my free time last week,
                so I wasn't able to get as much work done as I would've liked.

            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for this coming week is to fix some long-standing 
                bugs in the client and server. In particular, I want to have 
                the server handle client disconnects gracefully and have 
                the recv call handled in a loop. Additionally, I want to make 
                sure we can run the graphics client and server on the lab 
                computers. If I have additional time, I'm going to start moving 
                the camera logic to the server.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned about namespaces while trying to debug the jumping 
                logic on the server. Apparently, the topic of namespaces can
                trigger some pretty intense debate over proper software design, 
                which is how I also found out that my code is probably 
                violating a ton of design principles right now.

            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm so glad to finally be working on the game again and not some 
                infernal paper. I will take seg faults over writing a topic 
                sentence any day of the week.
