            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal was to continue to integrate the client/server with the graphics team.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                The integration is still a work in progress but I was able to flesh out the packets more and get started on client ticks.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
              I fortunately didn't run into anything too unexpected this week.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                Finish implementing the client ticks (and figuring out how to resync it with the server or do checks with them) and any further integration needed with graphics
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                For this week I mostly learned more about the graphics side of things, specifically OpenGL.
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                Some lows as I feel like I spent most of the week on debugging (which in hindset could've been better if I planned it out more) but feel like I have a better understanding of the code to tackle it next week.
