            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for this week is to add UI to the game using imGUI (and collision).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I created a start menu and character selection page, and I added a tool bar at the bottom of the window during gameplay.<br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I didn't really work on the collision part of the game but I am planning on working tonight.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                1. add a waiting room (similar to the one in APEX? So player can see and walk around with the character they chose before game starts ) <br>
                2. make adjustments: adding icon for each ability, add background to start menu, etc. <br>
                3. fix the flickering issue with UI <br>
            </p>

        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                learned about what imgui can do.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report-subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                Good.
