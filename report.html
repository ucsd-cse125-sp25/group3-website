        <h3>Overall Status</h3>
        <p>The project is coming along. For networking, packets are more generalized and the two thief abilities and jumping are now handled by the server. For gameplay, NPCs have randomly generated positions and paths. Also started on implementing the re-entering game and have set up the start for it. For the UI aspect, the start menu game state now handles character selection and there is a toolbar ready for when we start adding items. For graphics, we’ve finished adding textures, assimp works, and the graphics branch is reorganized.</p>
        <h3>Group Morale</h3>
        <p>There is some nervousness about next steps but feeling good about the project overall</p>

        <h3>Overall Status</h3>
        <p>It is going well and we were able to meet our goals for the week. For art, the models were revamped and base color was added. Most of the server graphics integration is done, just need to work on some key inputs and incorporate the new gameplay logic introduced in the last week. For gameplay, abilities were added and characters can be picked; still need to work on the multiplayer aspect for abilities. A minimap also now appears on the upper lefthand corner and players can grab artifacts nearby. For physics, collision detection was added between acis aligned bounding boxes and for converting the initial bounding boxes into world coordinate axis aligned bounding boxes. </p>

        <h3>Overall Status</h3>
        <p>We are doing good. We were able to reach the weekly goal for graphics, but there are couple aspects that could be improved. Intergration might be difficult, but we will hopefully figure out. The artist was able to create two base character models, although the initial goal was to make three. The networking team was able to get the server/client running on both Mac and Windows. They're now able to run the OpenGL code and will begin integrating game logic, rendering, and input handling into the server and client. The gameplay team talk about the complete game flow and specify some details. It was able to make objects jump normally, get camera align move with cube, and create the free-look camera and disable/able of the mouse. Documentation with doxygen and added GitHub workflow to deploy website to server. Also, the gameplay part can now run on both mac and windows. </p>

        <h3>Overall Status</h3>
        <p>The project's coming along well across all areas. For art, we've created designs for the floor plan as well as models for the thieves and the security guard. On the graphics side, we’ve got the cube moving. The networking team has the echo server working with ticks and is moving ahead with Winsock. For gameplay, we added physics to the jump function and implemented velocity, so now the cube keeps moving while a key is pressed. Overall, we were able to meet the goals we set for the week.</p>
        <h3>Group Morale</h3>
        <p>We're feeling pretty good about the project!</p>
