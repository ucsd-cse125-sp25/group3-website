            <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
            <p>
                For networking, our concrete goals for the week was to get an echo 
                server up and working, and begin developing a full server and client.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection">
            <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to get an echo server and client working using Winsock, 
                with both client and server running on the same machine. I also modified 
                the server loop so that each iteration takes 30 milliseconds. Finally, I 
                separated out the server and client code (originally, both server and 
                client were being initialized and run in the same file) so that we can, 
                in theory, run the server and client on separate machines.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection">
            <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
            <p>
                I was hoping to get the echo server and client working on separate 
                machines, but it seems like the lab computers have a firewall 
                preventing inbound TCP connections. Since I myself do not own a 
                Windows device and our code currently only works on Windows, I 
                can't just run the server on my own laptop. 

            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection">
            <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for next week is to get a full client and server working, 
                which means incorporating the game logic into the server, 
                figuring out packet structures, modifying the client to recieve
                input from the user, etc. Additionally, though not originally a 
                goal I had, I’d like to rewrite the server and client so 
                that they can also work on MacOS, not just Windows. This way, 
                I don’t need to be in the lab to work on my code.

            <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h2>
            <p>
                Unsurprisingly, I’m getting a better idea of how Winsocks, as 
                well as basic networking, works. I’m also slowly but surely 
                relearning C++ (the amount of time I spent debugging basic 
                C++ issues was frankly embarrassing).

        <div id="subsection">
            <h2>What is your individual morale?</h2>
            <p>
                I don't want to say that I currently feel good because I'll 
                jinx myself, but I will say that I'm happy with what I 
                accomplished last week and am excited to continue fleshing
                out the server and client this coming week.
